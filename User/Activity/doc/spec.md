# Activity

## Description

This entity represents the current activity performed by an user. It can be used in different
scenarios, from modeling social activities on a web site (e.g. Federico shares a picture of his dog) to real life activities (e.g. Federico drives his car to work). The model is largely inspired by
[https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core).

The model is represents users activities using the following predicate structure: `(Actor, Verb, Object*, Target*)`, where `Object` and `Target` are optional.

The `Actor` is identified by the attribute `refActor`, the `Verb` is identified by `activityType`, the `Object` is identified by `refObject`, and the `Target` is identified by `refTarget`. In generally it is assumed that the different part of the predicate are references to other NGSI entities, with the exception of the `Actor`. Within FIWARE, `refActor` could point to the end of the FIWARE Identity Manager, where FIWARE user profiles are stored.

## Open Issues

- [ ] Discuss if location should be included as part of the model. Consider that the model is referenced in UserContext, where user location is already modelled.
